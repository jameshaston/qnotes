# Introduction to Dotfiles 

Dotfiles, denoted by a `.` preceding the file name, are hidden configuration files in your home directory that control
the settings and preferences for applications and your system environment. 

These files give you the ability to fine tune your tools and system to work exactly as you prefer. For instance, you
can add custom aliases, tweak style preferences, enable plugins, and more. With some configuration, dotfiles can become
a portable, customized environment that you can replicate across systems and machines.

Some examples of typical dotfiles on most systems are `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, and `.zprofile`. 

Here are some resources and examples for creating and managing a dotfiles directory:

# Symbolic Links 

A symbolic link, also termed a soft link, is a special kind of file that points to another file. Unlike a hard link, a symbolic
link does not contain data in the target file. It simply points to another entry somewhere in the file system. 

Symbolic links provide the ability to link directories and files, either locally or remotely. The `ln` command creates the symbolic link.

```sh
ln -s /path/to/existing_file /path/to/new_symbolic_link
```

The existing file can be a file or a directory that the new symbolic link points to. After making the link, any operations or
executions can be performed on the symbolic link as if it were the existing link. 

> If you delete the source file or move it to a different location, the symbolic link will not function properly. 

For more information about symbolic links, see the man page using your shell: `man ln`.  


# Tools for Managing Dotfiles

- Github for hosting your dotfiles
- [GNU Stow for Managing Symlinks](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)  
- [Stow Docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/) 

See [zsh shell resources](34nc%20zsh-shell-resources.md) for detailed zsh resources. 

Also, refer to this [create a dotfiles folder](50kx%20create-a-dotfiles-folder.md) note for the basics of setting up a dotfiles directory.
